#Midterm Pole Vault Game!!!
#I chose making this game because I know there is a lot of complexity involved in this event.
#I thought this might help people understand polevaults complexity and better understad the sport.
#I wanted to incorporate luck but just didn't have enough time to add it in :( so I just left it as a stat for the player.
#I was also wanted to show that height is also a big factor in polevault but didn't have enough time aswell. But anyways i'll explain the 
game...
#the game allows you to select your player. One has better stats then the other. You are competing against yourself. 
#At the start of the game, players are prompted to select one of two characters: Michael or Miguel.
#Each character has unique stats including height, speed, consistency, technique, and luck.
#The player confirms their choice, and the corresponding stats are stored for use in the competition.
#Players must clear various bar heights to progress in the game, but just like the actual event you are able to jump to any height you want.\
#Each bar height has specific speed and technique requirements.
#lowest height available is 6 feet, and the player can choose a higher bar to attempt.
#When the player selects a bar height, the game checks if the playerâ€™s speed and technique meet the requirements for that height (just didn't 
have time to add other stat completion).
#If the player meets the requirements, they successfully clear the bar.
#If they do not meet the requirements, they are given two attempts to guess a randomly generated number (1-3) to achieve a "critical step" 
Just like the actual event you get 3 attemps to clear the bar
#I subtracted 1 attempt since they are used their first one saying they missed the height, forcing the player to lock in and guess the right 
number.
#this allows them to clear the height despite not having sufficient stats. There is alot of luck in polevault
#If the player successfully clears a bar, they can choose to attempt a higher jump or end the game.
#If they fail to clear a bar, the game ends, and the player is informed of their failure (just like the actual event you always end in 
failure).
#2nd term fianl make progression available for the character to either go and practice or compete at meets. bothh increase player stats 
(continue on final)
#create dictionary list that allows
 
#for different poles that let you jump higher
 
#for different people that let you have the chance of jumping higher
 
#for different shoes that make you taller
 
#(standards , takeoffs etc...)
